    "bio":"I am born and raised in Boston but have been residing in Atlanta for the last few years! In 2018, I started a Psychology program at GGC for my Bachelor's. Part of the general education program was to take either Graphic Design or Introduction to Programming. My first choice was Graphic Design but all of the classes offered were full so I got Introduction to Programming out of the way instead. Python - enters stage left, and I loved it! I had very little coding experience aside from a little HTML in my Myspace days but I was having way too much fun in that course. My professor noticed as well. That was pretty much all she wrote at that point. I've been self teaching via Udemy, Codecademy, etc. Any online resource you can think of, I've probably been on it. I was introduced to Per Scholas early 2020, applied, and was accepted for their accelerated Software Engineer program and have solidified that Software Developement is absolutely where I'm supposed to be!",
